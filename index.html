                        <h3>Early life</h3>

                <p>Khergiani was born Chumlian Minan Khergiani in the village of Mestia,</p>
                <p>in the historical province of Svaneti of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
                <p>His father, Vissarion Khergiani, was one of the first well-known Svan climbers.</p>
                <p>He scaled the two-peaked Georgian mountain Ushba in 1937.</p>
                <p>His uncle and cousin were also mountaineers, and the family introduced</p>
                <p>Khergiani to the sport early in life. </p>
                <p>After graduating from secondary school, </p>
                <p>he attended the Soviet School of Mountaineering Instructors in 1951.</p>
                <p>As his Russian climbing instructors could not pronounce Chumlian, </p>
                <p>they renamed him Mikhail, which he retained as his legal name throughout adulthood.</p>

                    

                        <h3>Career & death</h3>

                <p>In 1952, he and Shaliko Margiani shared the title of USSR Climbing Champion in Yalta.</p>
                <p>In 1956, he was named a Champion of the USSR for ascending a rock face near the village of Tyutyu-Bashi.</p>
                <p>He travelled to England in 1960 at the request of John Hunt, Baron Hunt,</p>
                <p>leader of the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition. There, he was nicknamed the "Tiger of the Rocks".</p>
                <p>In 1963, he was named an Honoured Master of Sport of the USSR. In 1964,</p>
                <p>he ascended Ushba with a group of climbers and was again named USSR champion.</p>
                <p>In 1966, he was given the Order of the Badge of Honour for outstanding achievements in sports.</p>
                <p>In 1967 he was named International Master of Sports of the USSR and Honoured Coach of Sports of the Georgian SSR.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1969, Khergiani and a group of Soviet climbers including Vyacheslav Onishchenko and</p>
                <p>Mikhail Anufrikov travelled to the Italian Alps for a series of climbs, </p>
                <p>the last of which was the summit of Monte Civetta. During Khergiani's ascent of Monte Civetta,</p>
                <p>a rockfall broke his rope. Khergiani did not have a secondary rope,</p>
                <p>and plummeted approximately 600 m (2,000 ft) to his death.</p>

                      

                        <h3>Legacy</h3>

                <p>He was buried in his home village of Mestia, where a museum dedicated to him now stands.</p>
                <p>Khergiani's fame was such that after his death, songs were composed that described Dali,</p>
                <p>the Svan cliff-dwelling goddess of the hunt, in mourning for him. In 1971, </p>
                <p>the Khergiani Rock Climbing Prize was established in the Soviet Union in his honor,</p>
                <p>and several peaks and climbing routes have been named for him.</p>
